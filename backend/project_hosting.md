Hosting your React + PHP + MySQL Inventory System online involves these 3 parts:

🌍 OVERVIEW:
Component	Hosting Option
🖥 PHP + MySQL	Free: 000webhost / InfinityFree
Paid: Hostinger, Bluehost, etc.
🌐 React Frontend	Free: Vercel / Netlify
🔗 Connect them	React fetches data from PHP via full domain URL

🧩 PART 1: HOST PHP + MYSQL (BACKEND)
✅ FREE OPTION: InfinityFree.net
Create an account

Create a new site (it gives you a free subdomain)

Go to File Manager → Upload your inventory-system PHP folder (with add.php, read.php, etc.)

Use the Control Panel → MySQL to create a database:

Note: You’ll get host, username, password, and DB name.

🔧 Update db.php like this:

php
Copy
Edit
$conn = new mysqli("sqlXXX.infinityfree.com", "your_user", "your_pass", "your_dbname");
✅ Test: Open your browser and go to:

perl
Copy
Edit
https://yourname.infinityfreeapp.com/inventory-system/read.php
You should see your JSON data.

💡 ALTERNATIVE (Paid / Easy): Hostinger or cPanel hosting
Upload files via cPanel File Manager

Import DB via phpMyAdmin

Set DB config in db.php

Done!

🚀 PART 2: HOST REACT FRONTEND
✅ Free Hosting: Vercel or Netlify
Using Vercel:

Push your React project to GitHub (create repo)

Go to vercel.com

Login with GitHub → Click "New Project"

Select your React project

It auto-detects Vite/React → Just click Deploy

Done!

📌 After deployment, your React app will be live at something like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://inventory-app.vercel.app
🔗 PART 3: CONNECT FRONTEND TO BACKEND
In your React project, update all fetch URLs like this:

js
Copy
Edit
fetch('https://yourname.infinityfreeapp.com/inventory-system/read.php')
So anywhere in your frontend where you had http://localhost/inventory-system/..., replace it with the online URL of your backend.

🎁 BONUS: Optional Tools
Task	Tool/Service
DB Admin Online	phpMyAdmin (via host)
Upload Files	File Manager / FTP
Hide API URL	Use .env file in React
Custom Domain	Use Netlify/Vercel domain settings

📌 Summary Steps
✅ Host backend (PHP + MySQL) → InfinityFree / Hostinger

✅ Host frontend (React) → Vercel / Netlify

🔗 Update React fetch URLs to use backend domain

🧪 Test live → Everything should work online
