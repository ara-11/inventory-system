🧱 Step 1: Install Node.js
React needs Node.js to work.

Go to https://nodejs.org

Download the LTS version (recommended)

Install it (just click Next/Next until Finish)

✅ This will install both:

node → the runtime

npm → Node package manager (used to install React)

✅ Step 2: Confirm Installation
After install, open Command Prompt (or PowerShell) and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
node -v
npm -v
You should see version numbers, example:

nginx
Copy
Edit
node -v → v20.12.2
npm -v → 10.7.0
If yes, you're ready!

⚛️ Step 3: Create Your First React App
In your desired folder (e.g., Documents/Projects), run this:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-react-app inventory-frontend
cd inventory-frontend
npm start
What this does:

Creates a new React app

Installs dependencies

Starts the dev server at http://localhost:3000

🔁 Leave this terminal open while you're coding. It refreshes your app live.

🧪 Step 4: Verify It Works
Go to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:3000
You should see the React welcome page.

Then you're ready to code! I can give you the code for fetching your PHP inventory next.
